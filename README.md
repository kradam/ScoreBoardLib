# ScoreBoardLib
I found an inaccuracy related to names in spec. There is Match and there are Games in ScoreBoard. I left it unchanged, but maybe it should be fixed in spec and code. 

It is likely that there will be a requirement to display completed matches. In this case, you can immediately implement marking completed matches instead of deleting them. As there was no such requirement, and there was a requirement for simplicity, I left it as it is.

Merged branches intentionally left.
